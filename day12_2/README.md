# Day 12

I had such a hard time trying to find a proper logic to follow with this challenge. Eventually I tried looking around at smarter people's answers and how they figured it out. Ultimately I took 0xdf's logic and translated it to Go. I feel bad about it but I'm just happy that this finally worked.

How long did this take to finish the second part of this puzzle? **7 hours, 39 minutes and 55 seconds**. I'd work a bit harder at trying to make this more efficient, but frankly I'd be happy to never touch this puzzle again. Good riddance.
